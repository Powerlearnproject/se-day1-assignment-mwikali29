Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science that revolves around developing ,testing,debugging and maintaining software solutions .
Its importances include:
Increased efficiency- the creation of software solutions plays an important role in ensuring that day to day activities run smoothly and much faster as compared to what they would be without them.
Security- due to the creation of various softwares users data and information is now safer and not as prone to threats as before.
Impartiality- these softwares can be relied on to be absolutely impartial and treat all cases the same way

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
preciseness- software engineering has come a long way in these terms as now one can develop software that give precise preciseand specific solutions which can be attributed to development of more refined programming languages.
increased productivity-introduction of new and more complex programming tools led to an increase in productivity.
increase in complexity of the codes and hence more abstract results

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-this is where you identify the purpose of the software and its scope
requirement analysis-this includes gathering of the requirements and also putting them down
designing-this is where you come up with a code for the software basically setting up the software's framework
testing- involves debbugging the software to get rid of bugs and ensure it fulfills its purpose
implemeentation- the product is pushed into an operating envronment 
maintenance-keeping an eye on the software to ensure its functioning as it is supposed to

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
WATERFALL
This model is where the next phase of development begins only after the previous one is done completely.
In this model;
              the possibility of bugs is high since testing is done at the end of the process
              there is no flexibility as it is hard to put in changes after a phase is over and it runs a high risk of ruining the done work
 a possible scenario for this model is for a medical device              
AGILE
This model on the contary consists of frequent changes and releases each with its own testing phase
in this model;
              the possibilty of bugs is low due to the continuous testing
              flexibility since more changes can be incorporated 
possible scenario for this scenario for this model would be a mobile app
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer -developing programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks and also maintaining them.
Quality Assurance Engineer- create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow and makes sure all criteria is followed
Project Manager-assembles and lead the software development team ,delivers the product to the client

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are platforms that allow for creation of other software s with beeter tools like eediting and debuuggging.eg VSCode.This help to save time and lead to creation of high quality product.
VCs are software tools that help developers make changes in the source code over time ,eg Git.These are instrumental in code recovery in case new code introduces errors.They also allow different developers to collaborate.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines-this could be remedied by using agile methodology
changes in technologies-the use of agile methodology also applies here since you can adjustbthe code to accomodate the new changes
emergence of new threata-keepng up with new cybersecurity technologies

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the components of your software.
Integration tests - verify that different modules used by your application work well together and help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
System testing -Focus on the entire software system and it helps to verify that the system meets all  requirements .


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering is the process of instructing and guiding generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.It is quite useful as it enables the user to get relevant answers on the prompt reducing frustations.It also helps the models to understand the different queries.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
VAGUE
Show me prices of a black car.
IMPROVED
Show the price of a black, four wheel drive,four seater ,mercedes benz brabus g wagon
the improved is precise on exactly what to expect
